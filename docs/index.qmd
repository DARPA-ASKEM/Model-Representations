# Introduction {.unnumbered}

This document compiles some of the informal contracts across different implementations of the ASKEM modeling framework, as broadly construed.

Here we try to answer some questions like

- What does a modeling framework consist of?
- What is syntax for models?
- How do we go from syntax to semantics?

Obviously this is a work in progress; we're going to start by "working in the small" and specifying examples before getting to the bigger picture.

## TODO

- Comprehensive references for Petri nets
  - Syntax
  - Semantics
- Comprehensive references for regulatory nets
- Ontological overview of program
