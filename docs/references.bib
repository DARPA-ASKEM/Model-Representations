	abstract = {Reaction networks, or equivalently Petri nets, are a general
	            framework for describing processes in which entities of various
	            kinds interact and turn into other entities. In chemistry, where
	            the reactions are assigned "rate constants", any reaction network
	            gives rise to a nonlinear dynamical system called its "rate
	            equation". Here we generalize these ideas to "open" reaction
	            networks, which allow entities to flow in and out at certain
	            designated inputs and outputs. We treat open reaction networks as
	            morphisms in a category. Composing two such morphisms connects the
	            outputs of the first to the inputs of the second. We construct a
	            functor sending any open reaction network to its corresponding "
	            open dynamical system". This provides a compositional framework for
	            studying the dynamics of reaction networks. We then turn to
	            statics: that is, steady state solutions of open dynamical systems.
	            We construct a "black-boxing" functor that sends any open dynamical
	            system to the relation that it imposes between input and output
	            variables in steady states. This extends our earlier work on
	            black-boxing for Markov processes.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.1911.04630},
	abstract = {One goal of applied category theory is to better understand
	            networks appearing throughout science and engineering. Here we
	            introduce "structured cospans" as a way to study networks with
	            inputs and outputs. Given a functor \$L {\textbackslash}colon {
	            \textbackslash}mathsf\{A\} {\textbackslash}to {\textbackslash}
	            mathsf\{X\}\$, a structured cospan is a diagram in \${
	            \textbackslash}mathsf\{X\}\$ of the form \$L(a) {\textbackslash}
	            rightarrow x {\textbackslash}leftarrow L(b)\$. If \${\textbackslash
	            }mathsf\{A\}\$ and \${\textbackslash}mathsf\{X\}\$ have finite
	            colimits and \$L\$ is a left adjoint, we obtain a symmetric
	            monoidal category whose objects are those of \${\textbackslash}
	            mathsf\{A\}\$ and whose morphisms are isomorphism classes of
	            structured cospans. This is a hypergraph category. However, it
	            arises from a more fundamental structure: a symmetric monoidal
	            double category where the horizontal 1-cells are structured
	            cospans. We show how structured cospans solve certain problems in
	            the closely related formalism of "decorated cospans", and explain
	            how they work in some examples: electrical circuits, Petri nets,
	            and chemical reaction networks.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05382},
	abstract = {Herein we develop category-theoretic tools for understanding
	            network-style diagrammatic languages. The archetypal network-style
	            diagrammatic language is that of electric circuits; other examples
	            include signal flow graphs, Markov processes, automata, Petri nets,
	            chemical reaction networks, and so on. The key feature is that the
	            language is comprised of a number of components with multiple
	            (input/output) terminals, each possibly labelled with some type,
	            that may then be connected together along these terminals to form a
	            larger network. The components form hyperedges between labelled
	            vertices, and so a diagram in this language forms a hypergraph. We
	            formalise the compositional structure by introducing the notion of
	            a hypergraph category. Network-style diagrammatic languages and
	            their semantics thus form hypergraph categories, and semantic
	            interpretation gives a hypergraph functor. The first part of this
	            thesis develops the theory of hypergraph categories. In particular,
	            we introduce the tools of decorated cospans and corelations.
	            Decorated cospans allow straightforward construction of hypergraph
	            categories from diagrammatic languages: the inputs, outputs, and
	            their composition are modelled by the cospans, while the
	            'decorations' specify the components themselves. Not all hypergraph
	            categories can be constructed, however, through decorated cospans.
	            Decorated corelations are a more powerful version that permits
	            construction of all hypergraph categories and hypergraph functors.
	            These are often useful for constructing the semantic categories of
	            diagrammatic languages and functors from diagrams to the semantics.
	            To illustrate these principles, the second part of this thesis
	            details applications to linear time-invariant dynamical systems and
	            passive linear networks.},

	abstract = {Many mathematical objects can be represented as functors from
	            finitely-presented categories \${\textbackslash}mathsf\{C\}\$ to \$
	            {\textbackslash}mathsf\{Set\}\$. For instance, graphs are functors
	            to \${\textbackslash}mathsf\{Set\}\$ from the category with two
	            parallel arrows. Such functors are known informally as \${
	            \textbackslash}mathsf\{C\}\$-sets. In this paper, we describe and
	            implement an extension of \${\textbackslash}mathsf\{C\}\$-sets
	            having data attributes with fixed types, such as graphs with
